# [Hackathon 2] Classification: Diabetes Health indicators

## How to solve this Hackathon

- Install the minimum requirements in `requirement.txt`
    * If you use a UNIX terminal (MacOS or Linux), go to the main Hackathon folder with `cd` commands
    * Install the requirements with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Modify the .ipynb notebook with Jupyter Notebooks. We do not guarantee that the notebook works well in another editor such as VSCode

## How to verify that the functions are well formatted

Together with this hackathon, we provide `sanity_check.py`, a sanity check script that verifies that the functions you have to write are well formatted. 

- Make sure you have installed the requirements as explained above
- In Jupyter, download your notebook as a .py file (File > Download as > Python (.py))
- Put the .py file in the same directory as `sanity_check.py`
- Execute the script with `FILENAME.py` as argument, where `FILENAME` is the name of the downloaded .py file
    * If you use a UNIX terminal (MacOS or Linux), go to the main Hackathon folder with `cd` commands
    * Execute `python3 sanity_check.py FILENAME.py`
- Make sure that all the tests have passed. If the script raises an error, your notebook is not ready to be submitted
